#  LLM Evaluation Platform

A sleek and modern platform for comparing responses from different Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-time. Test prompts across multiple models and analyze their performance metrics side by side.



##  Features

- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Test prompts simultaneously across:
  - GPT-4 (OpenAI's most advanced model)
  - GPT-3.5 (FastAI)
  - Mixtral (via Groq)

- **Real-time Metrics**:
  - Accuracy measurements
  - Response relevancy scoring
  - Response time tracking
  - Performance analytics

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Clean, modern UI
  - Real-time response generation
  - Performance visualization
  - Historical data tracking

- **Usability Features**:
  - Enter key support for quick evaluation
  - Responsive design
  - Easy-to-read metrics
  - One-click analytics access
